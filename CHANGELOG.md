# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Internationalization (i18n)** - Full localization system using i18next with English and German support. All ~880 UI strings across the app are now translatable.
- **Language Selector** - New dropdown in Settings to switch the UI language instantly. Supports "Auto (System)" detection and manual override.
- **System Locale Detection** - New `get_system_locale` Rust command reads LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/LANG environment variables to auto-detect the user's preferred language.
- **Translation Guide** - New `TRANSLATING.md` with step-by-step instructions for community translators. Weblate-compatible JSON format.
- **Locale Files** - 10 namespace files per language (common, dashboard, launch, installation, runners, environments, settings, setup, about, dialogs) in `src/locales/{lang}/`.

### Changed
- Static HTML elements (sidebar navigation, window buttons) now use `data-i18n` attributes for translation at startup.
- Module-level constants with UI strings (`LAUNCH_OPTIONS`, `CHECK_ITEMS`, `INSTALL_PHASES`, `QUALITY_LEVELS`, `SHADER_LEVELS`) converted to functions for deferred translation resolution.
- USER.cfg dropdown labels (Window Mode, Renderer, SSDO, Motion Blur) are now translatable via locale keys.
- `AppConfig` extended with optional `language` field (backward-compatible via serde default).

## [0.3.6] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- AppImage-safe folder opening using D-Bus XDG Portal with fallback to xdg-open.
- Browser launch in new window mode to prevent blocking the main app.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Set CLOEXEC on all inherited fds (3-1023) at startup, not just fd 1023, to prevent any child process from keeping the AppImage FUSE mount busy.
- Use `_exit()` instead of `exit()` to bypass GTK/WebKitGTK atexit handlers that can deadlock during shutdown.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- AppImage FUSE keepalive fd marked CLOEXEC at startup so child processes (wine, wineserver) never inherit it, ensuring clean exit.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- UI scale slider now uses pixel-based font sizing instead of percentage, fixing the bug where 90% made the UI larger instead of smaller.
- All CSS font sizes converted from px to rem so UI scale setting affects all text uniformly.
- Removed hard 1280x900 window size clamp that prevented saving larger window sizes; now clamps only to monitor bounds.
- XWayland/AppImage font size compensation so that 100% UI scale matches native Wayland appearance.
- AppImage process no longer lingers after closing the window (close fd 1023 to signal the FUSE daemon).
- Clean shutdown of all child processes (game, wineserver) when the app is closed.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- Integrated automated screenshot bot for website and documentation assets.
- New Rust command for system-level window capture supporting multiple Linux backends (KDE, GNOME, Wayland).

### Fixed
- Improved external link robustness in AppImage builds via D-Bus XDG Portal escape.
- Removed various compiler warnings and deprecated API usage in the backend.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- Robust external link handling for AppImage via D-Bus XDG Desktop Portal escape.

### Changed
- Refactored `openUrl` to a custom Rust-based `open_browser` command for increased reliability in sandboxed environments.
- Version bump to v0.3.0.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- Built-in `xdg-open` handling in AppImage.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **RSI Launcher in AppImage** - Fixed RSI Launcher window not appearing in AppImage builds by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH with system paths first for Vulkan, and adding XDG_RUNTIME_DIR fallback for X11/Wayland connections

### Changed
- Version bump to v0.2.4

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Version bump to v0.2.1

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Multi-Device Bindings** - New "+" button on keybindings to add bindings for additional devices (e.g., add a joystick binding alongside an existing keyboard binding)
- **Auto-Select New Profile** - Newly created profiles are now immediately set as the active profile

### Fixed
- **Binding Editor Dialog** - Fixed invisible binding editor modal (missing `.show` class for CSS opacity transition)
- **Remove Binding** - Removing a binding no longer deletes all bindings for that action; only the specific device binding is removed
- **Version Selector Highlight** - Active version card now uses a visible cyan accent instead of blending into the background

### Changed
- **Device Reordering** - Swap logic now operates on profile backups instead of live SC files, scoped by device type
- **Version Selector** - Improved empty state detection

## [0.1.9] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Environment Management** - Renamed "Profiles" page to "Environments" to better reflect its role in managing game versions, storage, and settings
- **Empty State UI** - New setup screen for missing versions with options to "Create Folder", "Symlink Data.p4k" (space-saving), or "Copy Data.p4k"
- **Git-style Profile Actions** - Added "Update Profile" (save current game files back to profile) and "Revert" (discard local game changes) buttons to the active profile header
- **Environment Deletion** - Safe deletion of Star Citizen version folders with safety whitelist

### Fixed
- **Profile Metadata Error** - Fixed path logic in profile update command
- **Character File Backup** - Profile updates now correctly include `.chf` character files

- **Import from Version** - Non-destructive import that creates a saved profile instead of overwriting SC files
- **Profile Cards** - Wider card layout (340px min) so profile names are fully readable
- **Contextual Hints** - Dismissible guidance hints for profiles, bindings, and devices sections

### Added

- Device name resolution in binding list via device map

### Removed

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- **Launch Page** - Separated Wayland into a dedicated experimental section with clearer documentation

- **Device Identity** - Corrected device identity resolution to properly match controllers using product name instead of instance numbers
- **Binding UI** - Improved binding display and interaction on the Controllers page

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Binding Export** - Fixed v_pitch and other bindings not appearing in exported actionmaps.xml when they didn't exist in the original SC bindings
- **Device Instance Mapping** - Fixed bindings being exported to wrong joystick instances by properly matching devices via product name and GUID

### Added
- **Device Reconciliation** - New "Reconcile Devices" button on Profiles page that syncs device instances with current SC actionmaps.xml configuration. This handles cases where device order changes (e.g., input-remapper changes joystick assignments)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-02

### Changed
- **Controllers Page** - Separated controller and binding management into a dedicated "Controllers" page accessible from the sidebar. The Profiles page now focuses on backups and USER.cfg settings only.
