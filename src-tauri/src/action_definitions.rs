//! Action definitions and binding data structures.
//!
//! This module defines the types used for categorized action definitions
//! (e.g. spaceship, vehicle, and on-foot controls) as well as the
//! complete binding list that merges default master bindings with
//! user-defined customizations.
//!
//! The structures serve as the data model between the Rust backend and the
//! JavaScript frontend — they are serialized as JSON via Tauri commands.
